# Files Folder

## Overview

This folder contains scripts and output files related to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) project. The files are organized as follows:

### Scripts

- **`decision-list.py`**: This script implements the WSD algorithm using a decision list approach. It reads the training and testing XML files, calculates probabilities, creates a decision list, and performs disambiguation. 

- **`scorer.py`**: This script evaluates the performance of the disambiguation results. It compares the predicted senses with the gold standard answers, computes the confusion matrix, and calculates accuracy.

### Output Files

- **Decision List Output (`OUTPUT`)**: This file contains the decision list generated by `decision-list.py`. It includes the computed probabilities for different senses and is used to make sense assignments during disambiguation.

- **Disambiguated Answers (`OUTPUT_ANSWERS`)**: This file contains the disambiguated senses for the testing dataset. It is generated by `decision-list.py` and is used by `scorer.py` for evaluation.

### Instructions

1. **Update Paths**: Ensure that the paths to the XML files and output files in `decision-list.py` and `scorer.py` are correctly set to match your local setup.

2. **Running Scripts**:
   - **Decision List Script**: Execute `decision-list.py` to generate the decision list and perform disambiguation.
     ```bash
     python decision-list.py
     ```
   - **Scorer Script**: Execute `scorer.py` to evaluate the disambiguation results.
     ```bash
     python scorer.py
     ```

3. **Check Logs**: Review the log files (`decision-list-log.txt` for `decision-list.py` and `scorer-log.txt` for `scorer.py`) for execution details and debugging information.

4. **Ensure XML File Format**: Verify that the XML files are formatted correctly before running the scripts to ensure accurate results.
