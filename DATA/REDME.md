# Data Folder

## Overview

This folder contains the XML files required for training and testing the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm. The data is organized as follows:

### XML Files

- **Training XML** (`TRAIN_XML`): This file is used to train the WSD model. It includes annotated instances with their correct sense IDs.

- **Testing XML** (`TEST_XML`): This file contains instances for which senses need to be disambiguated. The model will predict the sense IDs based on the context provided.
